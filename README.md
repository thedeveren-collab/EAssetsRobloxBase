# Staffing Base

Welcome to E Roblox Asset's High Staffing Private Github Repository
You can start with editing whitelist for now.

Copy with these lines to whitelist for now:
		[user_id] = {
			-- co-owner of assets
			products = {
				[111] = "AdBoard V1", -- No whitelisting system
				[112] = "AdBoard V1 Premium", -- No whitelisting system
				[142] = "PlaylistScript V1.4",
			},
		},
  (Change User Id)
  (Add that to Whitelist in whitelist module)

  Copy with these lines to whitelist for now:
		[user_id] = {
			-- co-owner of assets
			products = {
				[111] = "AdBoard V1", -- No whitelisting system
				[112] = "AdBoard V1 Premium", -- No whitelisting system
				[142] = "PlaylistScript V1.4",
			},
      reason = "PUT REASON",
		},
  (Change User Id)
  (Change reason without removing "'s" in PUT REASON)
  (Add that to Blacklist in whitelist module)

  That's all for now.
